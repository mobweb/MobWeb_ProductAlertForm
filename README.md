# MobWeb_ProductAlertForm extension for Magento

This Magento extension creates a new block that contains a form that can be used by your customers to place a request for a specific product.

A notification is then sent to a specified admin email address with information about the customer's request.

The list of "requestable" products can be configured in the Magento Admin Panel.

## Installation

Install using [colinmollenhour/modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman/).

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible. If you have a question or are confused about how something is supposed to work, feel free to get in touch and I'll try and help: [info@mobweb.ch](mailto:info@mobweb.ch).
